# Workout Tracker üí™üèº

This application is a fitness tracker that can record and display workouts over a range of dates. The user can input their workout, picking from a pre-seeded group of exercises or creating their own. Stacking multiple workouts in a single day is also possible. The application can display the total workout statistics on easy-to-read charts and graphs.

## Description

Fitness Tracker is coded using information seeded into a MongoDB database and managed with Mongoose. Route handling and data creation is handled with Express.js. As the deployed site is available through Heroku, the Mongo database has been set up with a MongoDB Atlas account.

## Installation

This project uses MongoDB, mongoose, morgan and Express.js. Install these packages if you do not have them on your local machine. 

## Usage

Remember to seed the database with ``npm run seed`` in the terminal before launching with  ``node .\server.js``. I used [Robo3T](https://robomongo.org/) to test the database, and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to visualize, test and troubleshoot routes.

## Testing

Testing of code was conducted in [Robo3T](https://robomongo.org), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) and in-browser; error messages were parsed there and in the VS Code command line interface. I have not been able to get the $addFields stage of aggregation to work correctly, and will continue to work on that to get this build to 100% functionality.
